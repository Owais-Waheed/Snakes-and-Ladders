# Programming Fundamental Project

I made this snakes and ladder game as a cocncluding project of my Pfun course. 
It is a multi-player text based game which demonstartes the use of basic programming constructs like loops, conditions, functions and some structures like dictionary and lists.

## How to Play
- Run the Python script provided.
- Enter the number of players (maximum 6) and their names.
- Follow the prompts to roll the dice.
- Climb ladders, avoid snakes, and aim for position 100.
